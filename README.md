# Banking Application Manual Testing Project
Welcome to the Banking Application Manual Testing Project repository. This project involves comprehensive manual testing of a web application designed for net banking, with the primary goal of ensuring its quality and reliability.

# Project Overview
As part of this project, I have conducted thorough manual testing of various modules and functionalities within the banking website. My testing efforts encompassed a wide range of features, including but not limited to:

* Balance Enquiry: Verification of accurate balance display.

# Testing Approach
I adopted a comprehensive testing approach by evaluating the application from both manager and customer perspectives. This approach allowed me to ensure that the application performs as expected for different user roles.

# Test Case Documentation
To maintain a structured and organized testing process, I documented test cases for each module. These test cases served as a reference point during testing and helped me efficiently identify and resolve issues. Detailed records of test cases, defects, and test results were maintained for reference and reporting purposes.
